Content: This submission contains three calculator programs:
1: BFCalculator: A calculator that performs operations with fractions and stores results in registers.
2: InteractiveCalculator: An interactive calculator that allows users to perform fractional 
arithmetic operations and store results in registers.
3: QuickCalculator: A simple command-line calculator for evaluating mathematical expressions
and storing variables using the BFCalculator.

Resources:
A number of resources were used to figure out and compose the contents of this project.
Notable resources include:
1: Oracle Help Center: A comprehensive Java guide used to navigate the 
language's basic syntax and features.
2: freeCodeCamp: A helpful resource used to learn about the characteristics of different
data structures and algorithms, namely strings and hash maps.
3: Peers: Discussion between peers from my section (namely Jinny Eo, Maria Rodriguez, and Jonathan Wang)
proved to be helpful as I built this project.
4: Instructor: Professor Rebelsky was a big help during class sessions, as he explained how to do the project 
in great detail and answered the questions I had about the problems I faced during the making of this project.
